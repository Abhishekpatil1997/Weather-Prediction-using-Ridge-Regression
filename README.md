#  Project Title: Weather-Prediction-using-Ridge Regression
This project aims to accurately predict daily maximum temperatures in New York City using a ridge regression machine learning model.
##  Please refer to the [PDF Report](./Weather_Prediction_Project_Report.pdf) for full details on the methodology, results, and analysis.
## Overview
- Historical weather data from 1970-2020 is used to train the model 
- Data preparation involving handling missing values, feature engineering
- Ridge regression model development and evaluation
- Improved model performance by adding rolling average and mean features
## Results
The ridge regression model achieves:
- Mean Absolute Error of 4.7
- R-squared of 87.5%
